= OpenShift Service Mesh and 3scale API Management Integration

This lab provides instructions for running the OpenShift Service Mesh and 3scale API Management Integration demo.

Audience: API Owner, Product Manager, Developers, Architects

*Overview*



In a Micro Services Architecture (MSA), there are different stakeholders for API Management and Service Mesh capabilities. Service Mesh provides observability, traceability, security and control to application develops and dev-ops engineers to monitor intra-service communications.

API management provides API providers and business owners ability to provide business API capabilities like security, rate limiting, billing and developer ecosystem.

This link:https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/cl-service-mesh-and-api-management-e-book-f28474-202104-en.pdf[eBook, window="_blank"] from Red Hat is a good foundation for understanding the interplay between Service Mesh and API Management in a MSA.

The *3scale API Management* engineering team, in collaboration with the *Red Hat® OpenShift® Service Mesh* team, have created a service mesh Mixer adapter for API management called *3scale Istio adapter*. This adapter allows 3scale API Management policies to be applied directly to communication that occurs between services in the service mesh.

== Manage BookInfo API through 3scale API Gateway

In this section, we use the Istio Ingress to the BookInfo application as a backend and configure the API Product in 3scale.

.BookInfo API Gateway using Istio Ingress with Service Mesh as Backend
image::images/bookinfo_sm_api.png[bookinfo_sm_api, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

With this configuration, the API Developers and Developer Apps send API request to the gateway URL provided by the 3scale APIcast Gateway, deployed separately. This in turn will validate the API user and redirect the call to the backend (Istio Ingress). Thus, each request flows through 2 gateways (APIcast and Istio Ingress) before it reaches the ProductPage service.


Follow the below steps to verify your *BookInfo* application is working:


. Open a browser window and navigate to:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
 https://reqbin.com/curl
----

. Copy and paste the following URL. 
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {bookinfo-api}/api/v1/products
----

. Click the *Run* button.

. Notice that the request is not authorized due to missing parameters. As the API is protected through 3scale API Gateway, a user key needs to be passed to authnticate the request.

. Try the request again with the following URL. 
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {bookinfo-api}/api/v1/products?user_key=3scaleapisecret
----

. The page will load the response information from the service. You will be able to see the _RESPONSE HEADERS_ and the actual _RESPONSE_BODY_. You should expect a *_HTTP 200_* response and the response JSON as follows:
+
image::images/online-curl-response.png[online-curl-response, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. You can also try out the `productpage` endpoint:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {bookinfo-api}/productpage?user_key=3scaleapisecret
----

. Repeat the above request 10 times to generate traffic.

. Open the link:{3scale-admin}[3scale Admin Console, window="_blank"] and login using the credentials below:
.. *username*: `{user-username}`
.. *password*: `{user-password}`

. Select the *BookInfo Product (API Gateway)* product.

. Click on *Analytics* and select *Traffic*.
. Notice the traffic recorded in 3scale as the API is now being accessed through the 3scale API Gateway:
+
image::images/3scale-bookinfo-api-traffic.png[3scale-bookinfo-api-traffic, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click on the *Integration* and select *Configuration* to check out the API configuration:
+
image::images/3scale-bookinfo-api-config.png[3scale-bookinfo-api-config, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]


. Also check *Kiali* and *Jaeger* consoles and confirm the traffic is coming to the microservices through the API Gateway.

[type=verification]
Were you able to access the Product API using the API Gateway endpoint?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that the productpage pod is running, and the APIcast pod in threescale namespace is running.

[id="manage-bookinfo-istio-using-3scale"]
== Manage BookInfo API through 3scale Istio Adapter

In this section, we use the Istio Ingress to the BookInfo application directly as an API Product in 3scale, using the 3scale Istio adapter.

.BookInfo API  using Istio Ingress with Service Mesh and 3scale Istio Adapter
image::images/bookinfo_sm_api_adapter.png[bookinfo_sm_api, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]


With this configuration, the API Developers and Developer Apps send API request to the Istio Ingress. The request is validated by Service Mesh using Istio Mixer configuration, and the 3scale validation is possible through the 3scale Istio Mixer Adapter. Thus, each request flows through to the Istio Ingress directly, avoiding having a separate APIcast gateway.


Follow the below steps to configure your *ProductPage* deployment in *BookInfo* for using 3scale adapter:

. Open the link:{openshift-url}[OpenShift Admin Console, window="_blank"] and login using the credentials below:
.. *username*: `{user-username}`
.. *password*: `{user-password}`

. Click on the *Terminal* icon to open the web terminal:
+
image::images/ocp-terminal-link.png[ocp-terminal-link, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Select the project *user1-serviceme-xxxx* and click on *Start*.

. The terminal should open in the console window within 1 minute.
+
image::images/ocp-terminal-console.png[ocp-terminal-console, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. In the terminal, enter the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
BOOKINFO_NS=bookinfo
SERVICE_ID=4
HANDLER_NAME=threescale
patch="$(oc get deployment -n "${BOOKINFO_NS}" productpage-v1 --template='{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{ {{ range $k,$v := .spec.template.metadata.labels }}"{{ $k }}":"{{ $v }}",{{ end }}"service-mesh.3scale.net/service-id":"'"${SERVICE_ID}"'","service-mesh.3scale.net/credentials":"'"${HANDLER_NAME}"'"}}}}}' )"
----

. View the patch and expect the following output:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
echo $patch
----

.Sample Output
----
{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{ "app":"productpage","version":"v1","service-mesh.3scale.net/service-id":"4","service-mesh.3scale.net/credentials":"threescale"}}}}}
----

. Apply the patch to the deployment:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc patch -n "${BOOKINFO_NS}"  deployment productpage-v1 --patch ''"${patch}"''
----

. Wait until a new deployment of *productpage-v1* is rolled out.


[type=verification]
Were you able to access the Terminal and apply the changes to the deployment?

[type=verificationFail]
Terminal is a Tech Preview application, so if this doesnt work, open a terminal in your laptop/computer, login to OpenShift and apply the above changes.

Now test the 3scale Istio Ingress Integration.

. Open a browser window and navigate to:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
 https://reqbin.com/curl
----

. Copy and paste the following URL. 
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {istio-ingress}/api/v1/products
----

. Notice that the request fails with a *HTTP 403 - Forbidden* error and the following message:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
PERMISSION_DENIED:threescale.handler.istio-system:no auth credentials provided or provided in invalid location
----

. Now try the request with the API Key for the *BookInfo Product (Istio)* application:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {istio-ingress}/api/v1/products?user_key=3scaleistiosecret
----

. The message should now succeed with a *HTTP 200 - OK* and a proper response.

. You can also try out the `productpage` endpoint:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {istio-ingress}/productpage?user_key=3scaleistiosecret
----

. Repeat the above request 10 times to generate traffic.

. Open the link:{3scale-admin}[3scale Admin Console, window="_blank"] and login using the credentials below:
.. *username*: `{user-username}`
.. *password*: `{user-password}`

. Select the *BookInfo Product (Istio)* product.

. Click on *Analytics* and select *Traffic*.
+
image::images/3scale-istio-product-traffic.png[3scale-istio-product-traffic, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Also check *Kiali* and *Jaeger* consoles and confirm the traffic is coming to the microservices through the API Gateway.
. In *Jaeger*, observe that the *threescale adapter* is used for enforcing 3scale security and rate limits in the Istio Ingress.
+
