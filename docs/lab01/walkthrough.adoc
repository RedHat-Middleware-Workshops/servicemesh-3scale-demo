= OpenShift Service Mesh and 3scale API Management Integration

This lab provides instructions for running the OpenShift Service Mesh and 3scale API Management Integration demo.

Audience: API Owner, Product Manager, Developers, Architects

*Overview*



In a Micro Services Architecture (MSA), there are different stakeholders for API Management and Service Mesh capabilities. Service Mesh provides observability, traceability, security and control to application develops and dev-ops engineers to monitor intra-service communications.

API management provides API providers and business owners ability to provide business API capabilities like security, rate limiting, billing and developer ecosystem.

This link:https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/cl-service-mesh-and-api-management-e-book-f28474-202104-en.pdf[eBook, window="_blank"] from Red Hat is a good foundation for understanding the interplay between Service Mesh and API Management in a MSA.

The *3scale API Management* engineering team, in collaboration with the *Red Hat® OpenShift® Service Mesh* team, have created a service mesh Web Assembly Module for API management. This allows 3scale API Management policies to be applied directly to communication that occurs between services in the service mesh.

[id="manage-bookinfo-api-using-3scale"]
== Manage BookInfo API through 3scale API Gateway

In this section, we use the Istio Ingress to the BookInfo application as a backend and configure the API Product in 3scale.

.BookInfo API Gateway using Istio Ingress with Service Mesh as Backend
image::images/bookinfo_sm_api.png[bookinfo_sm_api, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

With this configuration, the API Developers and Developer Apps send API request to the gateway URL provided by the 3scale APIcast Gateway, deployed separately. This in turn will validate the API user and redirect the call to the backend (Istio Ingress). Thus, each request flows through 2 gateways (APIcast and Istio Ingress) before it reaches the ProductPage service.


Follow the below steps to verify your *BookInfo* application is working:


. Open a browser window and navigate to:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
 https://reqbin.com/curl
----

. Copy and paste the following URL. 
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {bookinfo-api}/api/v1/products
----

. Click the *Run* button.

. Notice that the request is not authorized due to missing parameters. As the API is protected through 3scale API Gateway, a user key needs to be passed to authnticate the request.

. Try the request again with the following URL. 
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {bookinfo-api}/api/v1/products?user_key=3scaleapisecret
----

. The page will load the response information from the service. You will be able to see the _RESPONSE HEADERS_ and the actual _RESPONSE_BODY_. You should expect a *_HTTP 200_* response and the response JSON as follows:
+
image::images/online-curl-response.png[online-curl-response, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. You can also try out the `productpage` endpoint:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl {bookinfo-api}/productpage?user_key=3scaleapisecret
----

. Repeat the above request 10 times to generate traffic.

. Open the link:{3scale-admin}[3scale Admin Console, window="_blank"] and login using the credentials below:
.. *username*: `{user-username}`
.. *password*: `{user-password}`

. Select the *BookInfo Product (API Gateway)* product.

. Click on *Analytics* and select *Traffic*.
. Notice the traffic recorded in 3scale as the API is now being accessed through the 3scale API Gateway:
+
image::images/3scale-bookinfo-api-traffic.png[3scale-bookinfo-api-traffic, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click on the *Integration* and select *Configuration* to check out the API configuration:
+
image::images/3scale-bookinfo-api-config.png[3scale-bookinfo-api-config, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]


. Also check *Kiali* and *Jaeger* consoles and confirm the traffic is coming to the microservices through the API Gateway.

[type=verification]
Were you able to access the Product API using the API Gateway endpoint?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that the productpage pod is running, and the APIcast pod in threescale namespace is running.

[id="manage-bookinfo-istio-using-3scale"]
== Manage BookInfo API through 3scale Web Assembly Module

In this section, we use the Istio Ingress to the BookInfo application directly as an API Product in 3scale, using the 3scale Web Assembly Module (WASM).

.BookInfo API  using Istio Ingress with Service Mesh and 3scale WASM
image::images/bookinfo_wasm.png[bookinfo_wasm, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]


With this configuration, the API Developers and Developer Apps send API request to the Istio Ingress. The request is validated by Service Mesh and the 3scale validation is possible through the 3scale WASM. Thus, each request flows through to the Istio Ingress directly, avoiding having a separate APIcast gateway.

To have the 3scale WASM authorize requests against 3scale, the module must have access to 3scale services. You can accomplish this within Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh and Istio by applying an external ServiceEntry object.


Follow the below steps to configure your *ProductPage* deployment in *BookInfo* for using 3scale WASM:

. Open the link:{openshift-url}[OpenShift Admin Console, window="_blank"] and login using the credentials below:
.. *username*: `{user-username}`
.. *password*: `{user-password}`

. Click on the *Terminal* icon to open the web terminal:
+
image::images/ocp-terminal-link.png[ocp-terminal-link, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Select the project *user1-serviceme-xxxx* and click on *Start*.

. The terminal should open in the console window within 1 minute.
+
image::images/ocp-terminal-console.png[ocp-terminal-console, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Create Service Mesh Entries by entering the following command in the terminal:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/servicemesh-3scale-demo/main/docs/lab01/config_files/ServiceEntry_system-entry.yaml -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/servicemesh-3scale-demo/main/docs/lab01/config_files/ServiceEntry_backend-entry.yaml -n bookinfo
----
+
[NOTE]
===============================
This sets up the service entries for access from within Service Mesh to 3scale for the backend and system components of the Service Management API and the Account Management API.
===============================

. Expect the following output:
+
`serviceentry.networking.istio.io/system-entry created`
+
`serviceentry.networking.istio.io/backend-entry created`

. The ServiceMeshExtension custom resource spec provides the configuration such as API methods,paths,service ID etc that the Proxy-WASM module reads from. Follow the below steps to configure the  ServiceMeshExtension

. Retrieve the *Admin_Access_token* using the Console UI.
. Open the link:{openshift-url}[OpenShift Admin Console, window="_blank"] and login using the credentials below:
.. *username*: `{user-username}`
.. *password*: `{user-password}` 

. Select *threescale* project and Navigate to *Developer > Secrets* and search for *system-seed*
+
image::images/system-seed_3scale.png[system-seed_3scale, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Open the link:https://onlineyamltools.com/edit-yaml[online yaml editor, window="_blank"]

. Paste the above copied yaml into the editor as shown below
+
image::images/yaml-online-oidc.png[yaml-online-oidc, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. On line *17* replace the existing token value with the *Access token* obtained from Openshift Console UI earlier
+
image::images/yaml-online-access-token-oidc.png[yaml-online-access-token-oidc, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. On line *33* replace the existing ID value with the *Product ID* obtained from 3scale Admin Portal earlier
+
[NOTE]
===============================
Most probably you don't have to change this value as we set the value of the Product ID to 4 while setting up this demo. However it's always good to double check. 
===============================

. Create a Custom Resource Definition file for the Service Mesh Extension with name ServiceMeshExtension_bookinfo-oidc.yaml
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
vim ServiceMeshExtension_bookinfo-oidc.yaml
----

. Copy & paste the modified yaml into this file

. Save the file by hitting the 'esc' button followed by :wq and hit enter

. Please delete the ServiceMeshExtension created earlier
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc delete sme bookinfo -n bookinfo
----

. Now Apply the newly created CRD to your cluster using the below command
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc apply -f ServiceMeshExtension_bookinfo-oidc.yaml -n bookinfo
----

==== Verify Policy Enforcement

. You can now verify the policy enforcement by first calling the endpoint without credentials and then later using the api key.

. Open a browser window and navigate to:
+
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
https://reqbin.com/curl
----

. Copy and paste the below command. 
+
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl {istio-ingress}/api/v1/products
----

. You should see 403 status.
+
image::images/403-oidc.png[403-oidc, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

Postman will be used to test this flow as it has to open the browser to capture the user credentials. So, please install postman if you do not have it

. You can also If you have *PostMan* installed, you can use this to test the _Authorization Code Flow_. 
.. Set up a new `GET` request in *PostMan* for `productpage` endpoint:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{istio-ingress}/productpage
----

.. Click on Authorization and select OAUth 2.0 from the Type dropdown
+
image::images/postman-oauth.png[postman-oauth, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]


.. Now configure PostMan for Authorization configured as OIDC:
... *Access Token:* Available Tokens
... *Header Prefix:* Bearer
... *Grant Type:* `Authorization Code`
... *Auth URL:* `https://keycloak-sso.{openshift-app-host}/auth/realms/threescale-realm/protocol/openid-connect/auth`
... *Callback URL:* `Check the Authorize using browser checkbox`
... *Access Token URL:* `https://keycloak-sso.{openshift-app-host}/auth/realms/threescale-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token`
... *Client ID:* _From 3scale BookInfo Istio Basic App_
... *Client Secret:* _From 3scale BookInfo Istio Basic App_
... *Client Authentication:* _Send as basic header_

.. After choosing and entering the right values go ahead and hit the *Get New Access Token* button.
+
image::images/get-token-psman.png[get-token-psman, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]


.. The browser should open a login window asking for username and password. Go ahead and enter the below credentials 
... *username*: `{user-username}`
... *password*: `{user-password}`

.. Click on Open Postman
+
image::images/open-psman.png[open-psman, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

.. Wait for the authentication to complete and token to appear. Click on Use Token
+
image::images/use_token.png[use_token, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

.. The token is now populated in the Access Token Field. Now go ahead a hit send
+
image::images/send_btn.png[send_btn, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

.. The request should be successful and you should get a *HTTP 200 (OK)* response.

[type=verification]
Were you able to access the Product API using the Istio endpoint and Open ID Connect?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that the SSO configuration for Service Account Roles are set up correctly, and the client id for the app in 3scale is being synchronized in SSO.

== Extend the Example with other Microservices

You can use this framework to expand and connect with any microservices application running on OpenShift, and managed using Service Mesh. Get started with your own spring-boot or node-js application, add the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/service_mesh/service-mesh-2-x#preparing-ossm-installation[service mesh configuration, window="_blank"] and then configure 3scale API management using link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.10/html/service_mesh/service-mesh-2-x#ossm-threescale-webassembly-module[Web Assembly Module, window="_blank"].
